# SpringIntegration
SpringIntegration casus project in collaboration with Team Integration - Luminis Rotterdam

# Good to know
Never check in an authentication token in a public repository; it is a unique identifier that is used to 
authenticate you to Slack. Slack bots de-activated that token within a couple of minutes, which is very good. I should not have done that and 
won't do that again.
